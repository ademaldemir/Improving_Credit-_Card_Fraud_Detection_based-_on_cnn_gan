# Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection based on CNN/GAN

Within the scope of Machine Learning in Finance Course CS540 offered at \"{O}zye\u{g}in University in Spring 2021, “Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection based on CNN/GAN” is proposed to be investigated in detail for the Research Project. In this project, we aim to draw attention to a very common problem occurring ubiquitously, namely Credit Card frauds and make performance analysis of fraud detection techniques using machine learning approach.
